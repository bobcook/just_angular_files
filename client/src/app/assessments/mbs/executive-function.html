    <h2>Executive Function Test</h2>

    <p>You will see a grid of dots.</p>

    <p>There is a hidden path connecting the dots.</p>

    <p>The hidden path starts at the yellow dot on the bottom row.</p>

    <p>The path ends at the blue dot on the top row.</p>

    <p>Your task is to FIND AND REMEMBER this hidden path.</p>

    <p>You find this path by pressing the UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT arrows on your keyboard (see picture).</p>

    <p>You will be shown a green tick when you make a correct move or a red cross when you make an incorrect move.</p>

    <p>The path is always the same.</p>

    <p>Every time you get to the blue dot, you will be asked to start again at the yellow dot.</p>

    <p>If you find the path twice in a row with no mistakes, the task will end.</p>

    <p>Click <a class="btn" ng-href="{{vm.mbsUrl}}">START</a> to begin the test.</p>
