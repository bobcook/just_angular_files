<h2>Maze Test</h2>

<p>You will see a grid of dots.</p>

<p>There is a hidden path connecting the dots.</p>

<p>The hidden path starts at the yellow dot on the bottom row.</p>

<p>The path ends at the blue dot on the top row.</p>

<p>Your task is to FIND AND REMEMBER this hidden path.</p>

<p>You find this path by pressing the UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT arrows on your keyboard (see picture).</p>

<p>You will be shown a green tick when you make a correct move or a red cross when you make an incorrect move.</p>

<p>The path is always the same.</p>

<p>Every time you get to the blue dot, you will be asked to start again at the yellow dot.</p>

<p>If you find the path twice in a row with no mistakes, the task will end.</p>
