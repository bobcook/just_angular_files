    <h2>Recall Memory Delayed Test</h2>

    <p>A while ago, you saw a list of words shown one at a time (and repeated three times).</p>

    <p>You will now be asked which of these words you remember.</p>

    <p>You will again see three words.</p>

    <p>One is from the original list and two are new words.</p>

    <p>CLICK on the word you REMEMBER from the list as FAST as possible.</p>

    <p>You will then see the next three words.</p>

    <p>Click <a class="btn" ng-href="{{vm.mbsUrl}}">START</a> to begin the test.</p>
