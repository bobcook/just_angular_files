        <h4>What Do These Numbers Mean?</h4>
        <p>The questions you answered and tasks you performed measured your strengths in two vital areas:
        Neuroperformance, or how your brain works and Lifestyle, those activities in your everyday
        life that support brain health.</p>
        <p>We combined these results to give you one simple score.
        The graphs below indicate how you scored relative to others in your age group.
        Because science tells us that some cognitive functions decline as we age, while
        others remain stable, comparing your score to others of the same age is a valuable gauge.</p>

      <h3>My Future Brain</h3>
      <p>Your future is in your hands. A holistic approach to a brain-healthy
      lifestyle can actually enhance brain performance as you age. While
      science shows that it is normal for our cognitive abilities to decline
      over time, scientists also have good news. By making simple changes, you
      can make a tangible difference in how independently and actively you
      continue to live, work and play. Act today. Your brain will thank you
      tomorrow.</p>
