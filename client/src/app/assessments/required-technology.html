      The Brain Health Assessment currently requires Flash as it is not designed to be taken on tablets and mobile devices. Unfortunately, this device does not appear to support Flash.

      The best way to get a true reading on your brain health is to take the assessment from a laptop or computer in a quiet place where you can focus for 15-25 minutes.

      Please come back and take the assessment from a laptop or computer.
