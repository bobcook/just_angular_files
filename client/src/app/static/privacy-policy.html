We also collect information we receive from you during online registration and when you complete other forms.  In the following sections, we explain in more detail the types of information we collect online.</p>

      <li>Your browser type and language, and operating system;</li>

Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.</li>

      <h3>Information Collected By Third Parties</h3>

      <p>We may allow third party analytics companies, research companies or ad networks to collect non-personally identifiable information on our website.  These companies may use tracking technologies, including cookies and web beacons, to collect information about users of our site in order to analyze, report on or customize advertising on our site or on other sites.  For information about how to opt-out of the customization of advertising from many ad networks, you can visit here.</p>
      <p>We may provide links or automatically redirect you to third party websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement presented on our site, you may be taken to a website that AARP does not operate or control. You should review the privacy policies and terms of use of all third party websites you access. These third party websites may independently solicit and collect information from you. On occasion, those third party websites may provide us with information about your use of those sites.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
      <p>If you stay logged in to your social media accounts, log-in to our website using your social media account, use a “like” button or use other social media features while visiting our website those social media companies may collect information about you.  Your interactions with social media companies and the use of their features are governed by the privacy policies of the social media companies who provide those features.</p>

      <h3>With Whom Your Information May be Shared</h3>

      <p>AARP is committed to maintaining your trust and we want you to understand when and with whom your information may be shared.</p>
      <p><strong>Your Information May be Shared With:</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers.</strong>Service Providers are third parties with whom we may work to offer a service or feature such as a job search feature that is operated by Indeed or Linkedin. You can tell when you are accessing a service offered by a Service Provider because the Service Provider&#8217;s name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a Service Provider. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Service Provider, or we may share your information with the Service Provider. Please note that the Service Provider&#8217;s privacy policy may apply to its use of your information.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Media Advertising Networks. </strong>We may share information about you with social media networks to allow for the delivery of customized advertising about products and services that you may be interested in.  We provide this information to the social media network so they can deliver the ad to the right social media user. The delivery of customized social media ads, and your ability to opt-out of receiving those ads, is governed by the privacy policies of the social media companies who deliver customized ads to you.</li>
      <li><strong>Licensed Providers.</strong> Licensed providers are third parties who make available special AARP branded discounts, products or services. Some of the licensed providers of AARP-branded products and services, including many of those listed on the Member Benefits page on AARP.org, pay a fee for access to our membership list. These fees are used for the general purposes of AARP.  Licensed providers are required to keep AARP member information confidential, and to use the information only to offer the contracted products or services to AARP and AARP members. Some of our licensed providers may also collect data about our members through their interactions with the members. The licensed providers may share some or all of this data with AARP so that we may make available more effective and personalized service to our members.   We may share information including personally identifiable information collected with Licensed Providers, even if you are not an AARP member.</li>
      <li><strong>Corporate Affiliates.</strong>We may share information including your personally identifiable information with wholly or majority owned affiliates or other affiliated organizations, such as AARP Foundation, AARP’s charitable affiliate, so they can provide you with information about services, and programs that might interest you.</li>
      <li><strong>Approved Vendors.</strong> We may share your information including your personally identifiable information with companies we hire to provide certain services such as, sending mailings, improving advertising services, providing member benefits and managing databases or other technology.</li>
      <li><strong>Selected Nonprofit Organizations.</strong> We may occasionally engage in “list exchanges” with selected nonprofit organizations in which we may share your information including your personally identifiable information.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregate Data.</strong> We may share aggregate statistics and other non-personally identifiable information with the media, government agencies, advertisers and other third parties. These aggregate statistics will not allow anyone to identify your name or other personally identifiable information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>AARP May Share Your Information With Other Third Parties:</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Pursuant to Legal Requirements.</strong>AARP will disclose your personally-identifiable information in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement agency or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.</li>
      <li><strong>To Protect Our Website and Users.</strong>We will disclose your personally-identifiable information when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our employees, our website users, or others; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</li>
      <li><strong>In Connection with Business Transfers.</strong>We may share your personally-identifiable information as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order or in the unlikely event of a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of AARP or our affiliates, a merger, consolidation, asset sale, or bankruptcy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How We Keep Your Information Secure</h3>

      <p>AARP uses commercially reasonable physical, procedural, and technological security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to and improper use of the information we collect about you. For example, only authorized employees and authorized third parties are permitted to access personally-identifiable information, and they may do so only for lawful purposes. When we share aggregate data with third parties we prohibit them from re-engineering non-personal data to permit identification of individual users.  We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. However, No website or Internet network can be completely secure. Although we take steps to secure your information, we do not guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data/idt.shtm">U.S. Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s website</a> for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft.</p>

Please note that if you opt out of receiving communications from us, you may continue to receive material from Service Providers, and/or other parties to whom we provided your information before processing your request to opt-out of communications.

You also may opt out of receiving such emails by clicking on the &#8220;unsubscribe&#8221; link within the text of those third party emails.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Do Not Track:  AARP is in favor of the development of a Do Not Track standard that gives consumers control over the collection and use of web browsing information. When such a standard is finalized, AARP intends to respond to Do Not Track browser settings accordingly.  See for more information.  For information about how to opt-out of the customization of advertising by ad networks on AARP web sites, you can visit here.  Even if you opt out of the sharing of information for the purpose of customizing ads to your interests, AARP may continue to collect and use such information for other purposes.</p>
