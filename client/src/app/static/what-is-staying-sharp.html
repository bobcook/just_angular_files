      <h3>Staying Sharp is Personalized</h3>

      <p>Your brain health journey begins with a 20-30 minute Brain Health Assessment that measures how your brain works and how your lifestyle supports optimal brain performance. Once you take the assessment,
        you will receive a detailed report that provides insight on how your brain performs and how your lifestyle supports your brain health.
      </p>

      <p>The report includes activities chosen specifically to fit your lifestyle and brain health needs. You can save the activities that interest
        you most and get started right away, tracking your progress as you go.
      </p>

      <p>By integrating these small, simple changes in your daily life, you can help improve cognitive function over time.
